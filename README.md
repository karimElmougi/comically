comically optimizes manga/comics specifically for e-ink displays. live preview in the terminal shows exactly how it'll look on your device.

- tiny files that load instantly 

**actually fast:**

- 23 volumes of dorohedoro (4647 images, 2.5gb) 
   - to epub â†’ 45 seconds
   - to awz3/mobi -> 105 seconds
- 9 volumes of Alice in Borderland (3064 images, 4.5gb)
   - to epub -> 55 seconds
   - to awz3/mobi -> 77 seconds

**features:**
